# Mandelbrot Set Visualization

Welcome to the Mandelbrot Set Visualization project! This project aims to create stunning visual representations of the Mandelbrot set using simple math and X-Window API the MinilibX.

## Introduction

The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal that has captivated mathematicians and artists alike. This project provides tools to generate and explore the intricate patterns of the Mandelbrot set.

## Features

- **Rendering adjustment**: Generate high-quality images of the Mandelbrot set.
- **Zoom and Pan**: Explore different regions of the Mandelbrot set with interactive zoom and pan functionality.

## Installation

To get started with the Mandelbrot Set Visualization project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/cvrs3d/42prague-core-fract0l.git
	```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
	```bash
	cd mandelbrot
	```
3. Make the project
	```bash
	make
	```

## Usage

To generate a Mandelbrot set image, run the following command:

```bash
	./a.out mandelbrot
```
To generate a Julia set image, run the following command:

```bash
	./a.out julia <real part\> <imaginary without i\>
```
